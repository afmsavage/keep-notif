# Keep Network Discord Bot

This is the tBTC_Stats bot that runs on the Keep Network's [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/wYezN7v).  I used this project as a way to learn more about [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) and [ethers.io](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js), so there are some commands that use one or the other.  I would like to fully convert it to use only ethers moving forward.

To use, clone the repository and create a dotenv file (`.env`) that includes these 3 parameters:

- CLIENTID='xxx'
- CLIENTSECRET='123'
- BOTTOKEN='foo'
